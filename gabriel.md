# Calibrate your digital scales with every day items

## WTF

I use the skills learned in my profession, skills which started as baby steps in my personal computing life, to enhance my personal life. I use them every day.

I'm a digital nomad. I've been "nomading" for 15 years. Before "digital nomad" was even a term I'd heard of "Mi maleta es mi casa".

Any traveller'll tell you the weight of your luggage matters. I used to keep mine below 15kg: laptop, clothes, cameras, equipment, the bags which hold it all. But them airlines started lowering the cabin allowance and raising the price of checked-in. Greedy ffers.

Now I do 10kg. For everything. My whole life - in a bag. I internally mock them tourists with their 50kg wheelie bins going on a two week holiday to a place I intend to stay a year... with everything on my back like a hermit crab with missing leg... weighing less than their excitement.

I'm obsessed with weight. I know how much everything in my bag weighs. I have 10 SanDisk USB thumb drives in a little purse I got in Ecuador which has a herbal design. It weighs 43.1g. That's with 4 little cowrie shells in it as well. I have a DynoVap vaporiser protected in an aluminium tube. 193.85g.

I have two scales. One for my luggage. Some digital scales for... herbs... for cooking... [cough]... for checking the weight of any herbs I get... for cooking... [cough]... Very useful for establishing the integrity of your herb dealer.

But those scales occasionally need re-calibrating; and the calibration weight is 50g.

I have a choice. Do I add a bronze 50g weight to my already sparse luggage - perhaps leave those 10 SanDisk USB thumb drives in a little purse I got in Ecuador behind?! NO! I need those 10 SanDisk USB thumb drives in a little purse I got in Ecuador.

I'm a coder. And coding is fun.

So I wrote a script. Coders can write this script. Any one can use this script if you follow this simple recipe... to make 50g of calibration weight for your digital scales... for herbs.

You already know the exact weight of many things in your possession to a gram. On Wikipedia you'll find the weight of nearly every coin in circulation, for instance. The weight of your AirPods, the charger: all published by Apple. Need I go on? That battery for your digital scales? You can probably find out how much it is supposed to weigh. Do you happen to have any SanDisk USB thumb drives? I do?!

So... to make 50g, all you need to do is combine those items.
