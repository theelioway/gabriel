# Idea for App

When converting documentation, make every subfolder of `app/doc/lessonsLearnt/subfolders` a 'gist' with a description of "The lesson I learnt was" from an `index.md` file. When we render this Schema into documentation, we can also pull out "LessonsLeart" into a sibling app of `docs` called `lessonsLearnt`: "Lesson's Learnt Blog".
